Robobuds is a simple UI application I created using React.js and managed using Redux. 
The application pulls sample info from a third party API along with a custom robot friend and displays it neatly on a card component. 
The app is completely responsive and has an scrollable searchbar to sort through the buds. 
The app was styled using the Tachyons library and plain CSS.
